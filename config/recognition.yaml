    # Encryption algorithm: AES-256-GCM with PBKDF2 key derivation
    # - Key size: 256 bits
    # - PBKDF2 iterations: 100,000 (OWASP 2023 recommendation)
    # - Salt size: 128 bits (random per encryption)
    # - Nonce size: 96 bits (random per encryption)

    # Note: This is demonstration-level security for educational purposes.
    # Production deployments should use:
    # - Hardware Security Modules (HSM)
    # - Secure key management systems (AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, etc.)
    # - Regular key rotation policies
    # - Audit logging for all encryption operations
